## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Can't Find PC?
1. Check both devices are on same network
2. Restart Windows app (make sure it says "Server started")
3. Restart iPad app
4. Try manual connection: Settings → Connection → Manual IP

### High Latency (>10ms)?
1. Switch to 5GHz WiFi (most important!)
2. Move closer to router
3. Lower Stream Quality to "Very Low"
4. Close background apps on iPad
5. Check Windows Task Manager - close heavy apps

### Laggy/Stuttering Screen?
1. Lower Stream Quality
2. Reduce Target FPS (Performance Mode instead of Very Low Latency)
3. Check your WiFi connection speed
4. Update graphics drivers on Windows

### Touches Not Registering?
1. Check Active Area isn't too small
2. Adjust Pressure Sensitivity (increase it)
3. Ensure iPad screen is clean
4. Restart both apps

### Auto-Clicking Not Working?
It should work automatically! If not:
1. Check you're in **OSU! Mode** (not Screen Mirror Mode)

3. Try adjusting Pressure Sensitivity
4. Make sure Windows app is running as Administrator

## 🚀 Pro Tips
