## 🔧 How to Enable Advanced Features

### Option 1: Manual (Xcode Required)
1. Open `OsuTablet.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Add files to project:
   - Right-click Managers folder → Add Files
   - Add: `DeviceStorageManager.swift`, `StatsTracker.swift`, `ThemeManager.swift`
   - Right-click Views folder → Add Files
   - Add: `AlwaysOnDisplayView.swift`, `StatsView.swift`
3. Build and run

### Option 2: Git Branch Strategy
Create a feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/advanced-ui
# Manually add files to Xcode project
# Uncomment manager references in views
git commit -m "Add advanced features to Xcode project"
```

## 📝 File Changes Needed When Managers Are Added

### 1. OsuTabletApp.swift
Uncomment:
```swift
@StateObject private var deviceStorage = DeviceStorageManager()
@StateObject private var statsTracker = StatsTracker()
@StateObject private var themeManager = ThemeManager()
```

### 2. OsuModeView.swift
Add environment objects:
```swift
@EnvironmentObject var themeManager: ThemeManager
@EnvironmentObject var statsTracker: StatsTracker
```

### 3. ConnectionView.swift
Add device storage features:
```swift
@EnvironmentObject var deviceStorage: DeviceStorageManager
@EnvironmentObject var themeManager: ThemeManager
```

### 4. SettingsView.swift
Uncomment theme picker and stats section

## 🎯 Current Priority

**Keep the main branch stable and building.** Advanced features can be added later through Xcode project management or a separate branch.
