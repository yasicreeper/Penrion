# ‚úÖ CODEMAGIC CONFIGURATION FIXED

## What Was Wrong

Your Codemagic build was failing with:
```
‚ùå "No matching profiles found for bundle identifier com.penrion.osutablet 
    and distribution type ad_hoc"
```

### Root Cause
The `codemagic.yaml` was configured for **ad_hoc distribution** which requires:
- Paid Apple Developer account ($99/year)
- Provisioning profiles set up in Codemagic
- Code signing certificates uploaded
- Bundle ID properly registered

You didn't have any of these set up, so the build failed immediately.

---

## What I Fixed

### ‚úÖ Changed to Unsigned Build Workflow

**New primary workflow:** `ios-unsigned-workflow`

This workflow:
- **Builds WITHOUT code signing** - no Apple Developer account needed
- Creates a standard unsigned IPA
- Works immediately with no additional setup
- Perfect for jailbroken devices (AppSync Unified)
- Can be signed later with AltStore/Sideloadly (free)

### Key Changes in `codemagic.yaml`:

```yaml
# OLD (BROKEN):
ios_signing:
  distribution_type: ad_hoc  # ‚ùå Requires provisioning profiles
  bundle_identifier: com.penrion.osutablet

# NEW (WORKING):
CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="" 
CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO
CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO  # ‚úÖ No signing needed!
```

- Progress monitored in real-time
- Xcode compilation, archiving, and IPA packaging
- No user interaction required

### Step 4: Artifact Retrieval
1. Upon successful completion (green status indicator)
2. Navigate to "Artifacts" tab
3. Download: `Penrion-OsuTablet-Unsigned.ipa`
4. File size: ~50-100 MB (estimated)

## Deployment Options

### Option A: Jailbroken Device (Recommended)
**Prerequisites:**
- iPad running iOS 17.0+ with jailbreak
- AppSync Unified installed (available via Cydia/Sileo - Karen's Repo)

**Installation:**
1. Transfer IPA via AirDrop, Filza, or cloud storage
2. Open IPA file with package manager
3. Tap "Install"
4. App installs permanently (no expiration)

### Option B: Non-Jailbroken Device

**Method 1: AltStore** (Free, cross-platform)
- Website: https://altstore.io
- Requires AltServer on PC/Mac
- 7-day signing expiration (Apple limitation)
- Automatic renewal available when on same network

**Method 2: Sideloadly** (Free, Windows-friendly)
- Website: https://sideloadly.io
- USB connection required
- Free Apple ID sufficient
- 7-day signing expiration
- Manual renewal required

**Method 3: Paid Developer Account** ($99/year)
- 1-year code signing validity
- No weekly renewal needed
- Professional solution for long-term use

## Workflow Comparison

| Feature | Unsigned (New) | Signed (Old) |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Apple Developer Account | ‚ùå Not required | ‚úÖ Required ($99/year) |
| Code Signing Setup | ‚ùå None | ‚úÖ Complex setup |
| Provisioning Profiles | ‚ùå None | ‚úÖ Required |
| Build Success Rate | ‚úÖ High (simple) | ‚ùå Low (many requirements) |
| Jailbroken Install | ‚úÖ Direct install | ‚úÖ Direct install |
| Non-Jailbroken Install | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs AltStore/Sideloadly | ‚úÖ Direct install |
| Setup Time | ‚ö° 5 minutes | ‚è±Ô∏è 30-60 minutes |
| Maintenance | ‚úÖ None | ‚ö†Ô∏è Profile renewals |

## Troubleshooting Matrix

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "No provisioning profiles" | Wrong workflow selected | Use unsigned workflow |
| "Build failed exit code 65" | Xcode compilation error | Check build logs for Swift errors |
| "Scheme not found" | Project configuration | Verify Xcode scheme name matches |
| "Cannot install IPA" | Non-jailbroken device | Use AltStore or Sideloadly |
| "App crashes on launch" | iOS version mismatch | Verify iOS 17.0+ on device |

## Best Practices

### For Development
‚úÖ Use unsigned workflow during development  
‚úÖ Test on jailbroken device for quick iteration  
‚úÖ Monitor build logs for compilation warnings  
‚úÖ Keep Xcode project structure clean  

### For Distribution
‚úÖ Jailbroken users: Provide unsigned IPA  
‚úÖ Non-jailbroken users: Provide signing instructions  
‚úÖ Document iOS version requirements  
‚úÖ Include installation troubleshooting guide
