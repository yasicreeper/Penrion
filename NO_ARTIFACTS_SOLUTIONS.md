# üö® No Artifacts Section in Codemagic - Alternative Solutions

Since you don't have access to the Artifacts section in Codemagic, here are alternative ways to get your IPA file:

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 1: Email Notifications (Already Configured!)

Good news! Your `codemagic.yaml` already has email notifications enabled. You should receive build notifications at **yasicree9@gmail.com**.

### Check Your Email:

1. **Open Gmail:** https://mail.google.com
2. **Search for:** "Codemagic" or "Build succeeded"
3. **Look for emails from:** `noreply@codemagic.io`
4. **Open the latest build email**
5. **Look for a download link** in the email body

**Note:** Email notifications may not always include the IPA attachment. If not, try Solution 2.

## ‚úÖ Solution 2: Use Codemagic API to Download (Easy!)

You can download the IPA directly using Codemagic's API with a simple command.

### Step 1: Get Your API Token

1. Go to https://codemagic.io/
2. Click your profile icon (top right)
3. Go to **"User settings"** ‚Üí **"Integrations"**
4. Scroll to **"Codemagic API"** section
5. Click **"Show"** next to your API token
6. **Copy the token**

### Step 2: Get Your App ID and Build ID

1. Go to https://codemagic.io/apps
2. Click on **Penrion** app
3. Look at the URL, it will be: `https://codemagic.io/app/{APP_ID}/build/{BUILD_ID}`
4. **Copy both the APP_ID and BUILD_ID**

### Step 3: Download IPA via PowerShell

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
# Replace these values with yours:
$API_TOKEN = "YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE"
$APP_ID = "YOUR_APP_ID_HERE"
$BUILD_ID = "YOUR_BUILD_ID_HERE"

# Download the artifacts list
$headers = @{
    "x-auth-token" = $API_TOKEN
}

$artifacts = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.codemagic.io/builds/$BUILD_ID/artifacts" -Headers $headers

# Download the IPA
foreach ($artifact in $artifacts.artifacts) {
    if ($artifact.name -like "*.ipa") {
        $downloadUrl = $artifact.url
        Write-Host "Downloading: $($artifact.name)"
        Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $downloadUrl -Headers $headers -OutFile "C:\Users\yasic\Downloads\$($artifact.name)"
        Write-Host "‚úÖ Downloaded to: C:\Users\yasic\Downloads\$($artifact.name)"
    }
}
```

## ‚úÖ Solution 3: GitHub Releases (Automated Upload)

We can modify your `codemagic.yaml` to automatically upload the IPA to GitHub Releases.

### Would you like me to:
1. Add GitHub Releases publishing to your workflow?
2. This will automatically create a release and upload the IPA
3. You can then download from: `https://github.com/yasicreeper/Penrion/releases`

**Let me know and I'll update the configuration!**

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 4: Direct Download Link (If Build is Recent)

Codemagic sometimes provides direct download links in the build logs.

### Check Build Logs:

1. Go to https://codemagic.io/apps
2. Click **Penrion** app
3. Click on your latest build
4. Scroll to the **bottom of the build logs**
5. Look for lines like:
   ```
   IPA created in: /path/to/Penrion-OsuTablet-Unsigned.ipa
   ‚úÖ Build successful!
   ```
6. Sometimes there's a download link in the final output

## üöÄ Quick Action: Check Your Email First!

**Right now, do this:**

1. Open Gmail: https://mail.google.com
2. Search for: `from:codemagic.io`
3. Look for recent build notifications
4. Check if there's a download link

**Then tell me:**
- Did you receive any Codemagic emails?
- Is there a download link in the email?
- If not, which solution do you want to use?

## üí° My Recommendation: Add GitHub Releases

I can quickly add GitHub Releases support to your workflow. This means:
- Every build automatically uploads to GitHub
- Download from: `https://github.com/yasicreeper/Penrion/releases`
- Permanent storage (no 30-day limit)
- Easy sharing

**Want me to set this up? Just say "yes" and I'll do it!**

## üîç Troubleshooting: Why No Artifacts Section?

Some Codemagic accounts (especially free tier or certain regions) don't show the Artifacts UI section, but the files are still created. That's why we need alternative download methods.

**The IPA file WAS created during the build - we just need to access it differently!**
