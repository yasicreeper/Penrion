# üîÑ Settings Synchronization Feature

## Overview

The iOS app now **automatically syncs settings to the Windows app** when connected! This means:

‚úÖ **Screen quality settings** affect Windows screen capture  
‚úÖ **FPS settings** adjust Windows streaming rate  
‚úÖ **Performance mode** optimizes Windows behavior  
‚úÖ **Settings update in real-time** when changed on iPad

---

## How It Works

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ On Connection
When iPad connects to Windows PC:
1. iOS app sends current settings to Windows
2. Windows app applies settings immediately
3. Console shows: `‚öôÔ∏è Received settings from iPad`

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ When Settings Change
When you tap "Done" in Settings:
1. iOS sends updated settings to Windows
2. Windows adjusts FPS, quality, and performance
3. Changes take effect immediately (no reconnect needed!)

## Settings That Sync

### üìπ **Stream Quality**
iOS Setting ‚Üí Windows Effect:
- **Very Low** ‚Üí 30% JPEG quality, 144p resolution
- **Low** ‚Üí 50% JPEG quality
- **Medium** ‚Üí 75% JPEG quality (default)
- **High** ‚Üí 85% JPEG quality
- **Ultra** ‚Üí 95% JPEG quality

### ‚ö° **Latency Modes**
- **Low Latency Mode** ‚Üí Reduces buffering
- **Very Low Latency Mode** ‚Üí 144p 60fps, minimal processing

### üéØ **Performance Settings**
- **Performance Mode** ‚Üí High priority processing on Windows
- **Target FPS** ‚Üí 30 FPS (default) or 60 FPS (very low latency)

### üìè **Tablet Area** (future)
- Active area width/height
- Will affect coordinate mapping

## What You'll See

### On iOS (Console Output):
```
üì° Connection established - sending settings
üì§ Sending settings to Windows: {streamQuality: medium, lowLatencyMode: true, ...}
‚úÖ Settings sent successfully
```

### On Windows (Console Output):
```
‚öôÔ∏è Received settings from iPad:
  - Stream Quality: medium
  - Low Latency Mode: True
  - Very Low Latency Mode: False
  - Target FPS: 30
  - JPEG Quality: 75
  - Performance Mode: False
‚úÖ Settings applied successfully
üìπ Target FPS set to: 30
üé® JPEG Quality set to: 75
```

## Testing the Feature

### Step 1: Connect iPad to PC
1. Start Windows app
2. Connect from iPad
3. Watch Windows console for settings messages

### Step 2: Change Settings
1. On iPad, open Settings
2. Change **Stream Quality** to "Low"
3. Tap **"Done"**
4. Windows console shows: `üé® JPEG Quality set to: 50`

### Step 3: Enable Very Low Latency
1. Toggle "Very Low Latency Mode" ON
2. Tap "Done"
3. Windows console shows: `üìπ Target FPS set to: 60`

### Step 4: See the Difference!
- Lower quality = faster streaming, less lag
- Higher FPS = smoother screen mirror
- Settings apply instantly!

## Technical Details

### Message Format (JSON)
```json
{
  "type": "settings",
  "streamQuality": "medium",
  "lowLatencyMode": true,
  "veryLowLatencyMode": false,
  "targetFPS": 30,
  "jpegQuality": 75,
  "activeAreaWidth": 1.0,
  "activeAreaHeight": 1.0,
  "pressureSensitivity": 1.0,
  "performanceMode": false
}
```

### iOS Implementation
- **File**: `ConnectionManager.swift`
- **Method**: `sendSettings(_ settingsManager: SettingsManager)`
- **Trigger**: On connection + when settings change

### Windows Implementation
- **File**: `ConnectionServer.cs`
- **Method**: `HandleSettingsMessage(Dictionary<string, object> message)`
- **Applies to**: `ScreenCaptureService` FPS and quality

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:
- [ ] **Tablet area mapping** - Active area affects coordinate range
- [ ] **Pressure curve sync** - Windows applies same curve as iOS
- [ ] **Auto-detect optimal settings** - Based on network speed
- [ ] **Settings profiles** - Save/load presets
- [ ] **Live adjustment slider** - Change quality during streaming

### Potential Settings to Sync:
- Resolution presets (1080p, 720p, 480p, 144p)
- Color compression mode
- Frame skip on lag
- Audio streaming quality
- Multi-monitor selection

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå Settings Not Applied
**Symptom**: Change settings on iPad but Windows doesn't respond  
**Solutions**:
1. Check Windows console for "Received settings" message
2. Verify connection is active (green indicator)
3. Restart both apps
4. Check firewall isn't blocking messages

### ‚ùå FPS Still Low
**Symptom**: Set 60 FPS but still getting 30 FPS  
**Solutions**:
1. Enable "Very Low Latency Mode" (not just change quality)
2. Check Windows Task Manager - CPU usage high?
3. Use 5GHz WiFi instead of 2.4GHz
4. Lower quality setting to reduce processing

### ‚ùå Quality Doesn't Change
**Symptom**: Stream looks same on all quality settings  
**Solutions**:
1. Disable screen mirroring and re-enable
2. Check Windows console shows JPEG quality change
3. Network might be auto-compressing (WiFi issue)
4. Try extreme settings (Very Low vs Ultra) to see difference

## Benefits of This Feature

### ‚úÖ For Users:
- **No manual configuration on Windows** - Just set once on iPad!
- **Instant changes** - No need to reconnect
- **Optimal performance** - Windows adapts to your preferences
- **Better battery life** - Lower quality = less power usage

### ‚úÖ For Developers:
- **Centralized settings** - iOS is the source of truth
