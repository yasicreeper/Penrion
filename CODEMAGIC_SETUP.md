## Step 3: Configure Code Signing (For Signed IPA)

### Option A: For Jailbroken/Sideloading (Unsigned - Easiest)
- Select workflow: **"iOS Penrion (Unsigned for Sideloading)"**
- No code signing required!
- Click **"Start your first build"**
- Skip to Step 5

### Option B: For Regular Devices (Signed IPA)
You'll need an Apple Developer account ($99/year or free account):

1. In Codemagic, go to **Teams > Your team > Integrations**
2. Click **"App Store Connect"**
3. Follow the wizard to connect your Apple ID:
   - App Store Connect API key (for paid accounts)
   - OR Apple ID credentials (for free accounts)

4. Configure signing certificate:
   - **Automatic signing** (recommended): Codemagic handles everything
   - **Manual signing**: Upload your .p12 certificate and provisioning profile

---

## Step 4: Push the Configuration File

```powershell
# Add the codemagic.yaml file
git add codemagic.yaml

# Commit the changes
git commit -m 'Add Codemagic CI/CD workflow for iOS builds'

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

---

## Step 5: Start Your First Build

1. In Codemagic dashboard, select your app **"Penrion"**
2. Select the workflow:
   - **"iOS Penrion (Unsigned for Sideloading)"** - for jailbreak/AltStore
   - **"iOS Penrion OSU Tablet"** - for signed IPA
3. Click **"Start new build"**
4. Select branch: **"main"**
5. Click **"Start build"**

Build will take 5-10 minutes.

## Step 6: Download Your IPA

Once build completes:

1. Click on the completed build
2. Go to **"Artifacts"** tab
3. Download the IPA file:
   - `Penrion-OsuTablet-Unsigned.ipa` (for unsigned)
   - `OsuTablet.ipa` (for signed)

---

- ‚úÖ Store artifacts for 30 days

---

## Customization

### Change Bundle Identifier
Edit `codemagic.yaml`:
```yaml
environment:
  vars:
    BUNDLE_ID: "com.yourname.osutablet"  # Change this
```

### Change Build Settings
```yaml
instance_type: mac_mini_m1  # Options: mac_mini_m1, mac_pro
xcode: 15.0                  # Xcode version
max_build_duration: 60       # Minutes (max 120)
```

### Add Notification Email
```yaml
publishing:
  email:
    recipients:
      - your-email@example.com  # Change this
```

---

## Build Status Badge

Add to your README.md:
```markdown
[![Codemagic build status](https://api.codemagic.io/apps/<app-id>/workflows/<workflow-id>/status_badge.svg)](https://codemagic.io/apps/<app-id>/workflows/<workflow-id>/latest_build)
```

Get your app-id from Codemagic dashboard URL.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails with Code Signing Error
- For unsigned builds: Use `ios-unsigned-workflow`
- For signed builds: Verify Apple Developer account connection

### "No Podfile found" Warning
- This is normal if you don't use CocoaPods
- The build will continue successfully

### Xcode Version Issues
- Change `xcode: 15.0` in codemagic.yaml to match your needs
- Available versions: 14.0, 14.3, 15.0, 15.1, etc.

### Build Takes Too Long
- Check build logs for bottlenecks
- Consider using a faster instance type (paid plans)

---

## Cost

### Free Tier
- 500 build minutes per month
- ~50 iOS builds per month
- Perfect for personal projects

### Paid Plans (if needed)
- **Hobbyist**: $28/month - 3,000 minutes
- **Professional**: $68/month - 10,000 minutes
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing

---

## Alternative: GitHub Actions

If you prefer GitHub Actions instead, we can set that up too (requires self-hosted macOS runner or paid minutes).

---

## Next Steps After Build

1. **Download IPA** from Codemagic artifacts
2. **Install on iPad** using one of these methods:
   - AltStore (easiest for non-jailbroken)
   - Sideloadly
   - AppSync Unified (jailbroken)
   - Xcode (if you have a Mac)

See `IPA_BUILD_GUIDE.md` for detailed installation instructions.
