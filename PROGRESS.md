- Pressure levels: 8192 (13-bit)

## Known Limitations
- Requires both devices on same network
- iOS limitations on background processing
- Windows 10/11 required for companion app

## Installation Requirements

### iOS App

- Apple Pencil (optional, for pressure)
- WiFi connection

### Windows App
- Windows 10 version 1809 or higher
- .NET 8.0 Runtime
- Administrator privileges (for driver installation)

## Build Instructions

### iOS App
```bash
cd ios-app/OsuTablet
# Open in Xcode
open OsuTablet.xcodeproj
# Build for device (Command + B)

# OR build IPA for sideloading:
./build-ios.sh
# Output: release/ios/Penrion-OsuTablet.ipa
```

### Windows App
```powershell
cd windows-app/OsuTabletDriver
dotnet restore
dotnet build --configuration Release
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true
```

## Build Requirements

### To Build Windows App (.exe):
1. Install .NET 8.0 SDK from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
2. Run `.\build.ps1` from project root
3. Executable will be in `release\` folder
4. Run as Administrator for driver functionality

### To Build iOS App (IPA for Sideloading):
1. Requires macOS with Xcode 15+
2. Run `./build-ios.sh` from project root (on Mac)
3. IPA will be in `release/ios/Penrion-OsuTablet.ipa`
4. See `IPA_BUILD_GUIDE.md` for installation methods

### Installation Options for IPA:
- **Jailbroken:** Install with AppSync Unified (no signing needed)
- **Non-Jailbroken:** Use AltStore, SideStore, or Sideloadly (free)
- **Long-term:** Use paid Apple Developer account ($99/year)
1. Requires macOS with Xcode 15+
2. Open `ios-app/OsuTablet/OsuTablet.xcodeproj`
3. Configure signing with Apple Developer account
4. Build and run on iPad (iOS 17+)

## Next Steps
1. **Install .NET SDK** to compile Windows executable
2. Test iOS app on physical iPad device
3. Network connection testing between devices
4. OSU! integration testing
5. Performance optimization and latency reduction
6. Create installer package (future)
7. Submit to App Store (future, requires developer account)
