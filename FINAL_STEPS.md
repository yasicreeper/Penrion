## 🔥 What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Add Service Account to Codemagic ⚠️ CRITICAL

You need to add the **Firebase Service Account JSON** to Codemagic environment variables.

1. **Go to Firebase Console:** https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Click on your project: **"Penrion-OSU-Tablet"** (or whatever you named it)
3. Click **⚙️ gear icon** (top left) → **Project settings**
4. Go to **"Service accounts"** tab
5. Click **"Generate new private key"**
6. Click **"Generate key"** in the popup
7. A JSON file downloads (e.g., `penrion-osu-tablet-abc123.json`)

**Now add it to Codemagic:**

8. Go to https://codemagic.io/apps
9. Click your **Penrion** app
10. Go to **Settings** → **Environment variables**
11. Click **"Add new variable"**
    - **Variable name**: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
    - **Variable value**: (open the JSON file with Notepad and **paste the entire content**)
    - Check ☑️ **"Secure"** (IMPORTANT!)
    - Click **"Add"**

---

## Step 2: Trigger New Build

Once you've added the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` variable:

1. Go to https://codemagic.io/apps
2. Click your **Penrion** app
3. Click **"Start new build"**
4. Select workflow: **`ios-workflow`** or **`ios-unsigned-workflow`**
5. Click **"Start new build"**

Build will take **10-15 minutes**.

## ✅ What Will Happen

When the build completes successfully:

1. **✉️ Email Notification**
   - You'll receive an email at `yasicree9@gmail.com`
   - Subject: "Build succeeded for Penrion"
   - Contains: Build logs and artifact links

2. **🔥 Firebase Upload**
   - IPA automatically uploaded to Firebase App Distribution
   - You'll receive **another email** from Firebase
   - Subject: "A new build is available to test"
   - Contains: Direct download link!

3. **📱 Firebase Console**
   - Go to Firebase Console → App Distribution
   - You'll see your build listed with download button
   - Click to download IPA directly

## 📱 How to Install the IPA

### Option 1: Direct Download + Sideload
1. Download IPA from Firebase email or console
2. Use **AltStore**, **Sideloadly**, or **AppSync Unified** (jailbreak)
3. Install on your iPad

### Option 2: Firebase App Tester (Easiest!)
1. Install **"Firebase App Tester"** from App Store (free, official Google app)
2. Open app and sign in with `yasicree9@gmail.com`
3. You'll see "Penrion OSU Tablet" app
4. Tap **"Download"** → **"Install"**
5. Works just like TestFlight! ✨

## 🎯 Build Status Monitoring

While build is running, you can watch progress:

1. Go to Codemagic build page
2. You'll see these steps execute:
   - ✅ Set up build environment
   - ✅ Configure project for unsigned build
   - ✅ Build app for iOS device
   - ✅ Create unsigned IPA package
   - ✅ Verify IPA
   - 🔥 **Publishing to Firebase App Distribution** (NEW!)

If Firebase step succeeds, you'll see:
```
✅ Successfully uploaded to Firebase App Distribution
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT not found"
- Make sure you added the variable in Codemagic
- Variable name must be exactly: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
- Must check "Secure" checkbox
- Paste the **entire JSON content** (including `{` and `}`)

### "Invalid service account"
- Make sure you downloaded the JSON from the correct Firebase project
- Regenerate the key if needed (Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts)

### "Permission denied for Firebase App Distribution"
- Firebase automatically grants permissions to service accounts
- If you see this, regenerate the service account key

### "App ID not found"
- Double-check: `1:1061806026619:ios:61b583e58fe3683abb97de`
- Must match exactly in Firebase Console → Project Settings → Your apps

### "Build succeeds but no Firebase upload"
- Check build logs for "Publishing to Firebase" step
- Verify `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` variable exists and is marked secure
- Check Firebase Console → App Distribution for any error messages

---

## 📊 Expected Timeline

- **Build time:** 10-15 minutes
- **Firebase upload:** ~30 seconds after build
- **Email arrival:** 1-2 minutes after upload
- **Total:** ~15-20 minutes from triggering build to receiving IPA
